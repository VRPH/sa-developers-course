# VRPH: SA Developers Course

## Introduction
This is the first version of an experimental course on VR development. Basically, we want to go from this:

to this:

in a span of n weeks. In general, we will try to keep a breakneck pace (since everyone seems to be up to the challenge) and give ourselves lots and lots of things to think about. In particular, the course is based on the following principles:

* Questions >> answers
* Challenges should approach the ideal of the kōan and provoke "great doubt".
* But not great enough to require doubting for over an hour -- we're still students after all!

It might help to quote The Zen of Python here:

```
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

## Getting Help
The VRPH: SA developers group meets on Mondays and/or Saturdays on Facebook. If you have any questions, feel free to ask it on our group chat.

## Getting Started

Step 1: Install Unity3D and Blender

Step 2: Install Skype and/or Facebook Messenger

Step 3: ???

Step 4: PROFIT!

## Course Outline
We shall cover roughly one or two of these a week depending on our [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=vrphilippines@gmail.com&ctz=Asia/Manila).

01) Setting up our tools and schedule

02) Minimum Viable Coding Knowledge

03) Enter VR

03) Breaking Oculus' best practices

04) Design challenge # 01

05) A tour of C#

06) Design challenge # 02

07) A lesson in scale

08) Let there be modular levels (and there was light)

09) Design challenge # 03

10) The Theory of Fun

11) The future in our hands (i.e., input in VR)

12) Design challenge # 04

13) Principles of rapid prototyping

14) Design challenge # 05

15) How I learned to stop worrying and love UNET

16) Design challenge # 06

Post-16) Hardware + Unity3D? More 3D modelling? We'll talk about this later.
